# Ansbach Grizzlies, American Football Club from Germany ðŸ¥¨ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

## "New" & improved website 2.0

**Motivaion**:
The current website lacks any kind of structure and best practices in the code-base.  
I wrote it, you could say "hacked it", within 2 days or so just so the Ansbach Grizzlies had a website up and ready to serve content for the upcoming season.  
It doesn't even have a blog. The UI/UX is also suboptimal. I wanted to work with newer components!

**This being said** this is a WIP! I'm working full time in IT-Consulting and barely have any time for passion projects.
